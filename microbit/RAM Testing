Testing for available RAM, when trying to combine bluetooth and microbit functionality into main.cpp
Originally tried to simply add OnConnected and OnDisconnected functions, and add the listeners and Accelerometer service right before creating fibers. Current solution will be in Commits on GitHub.

Before buttons: 3 + 2/16 K
After buttons: 3 + 2/16 K
After BLE: 2 + 14/16 K
After 1 round of checking: 2 + 9/16 K
