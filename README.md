# Water-Watcher
My Computer Science A Level project.

The project uses the BBC micro:bit, connected to an Android app via Bluetooth. The project is designed to save water; the micro:bit, contained in silicon, is strapped to a tap. Using the accelerometer, the micro:bit is able to sense vibrations to know when the tap is running; if it runs for too long, it will trigger an alert to remind the user to turn the tap off. This will connect to an Android app that allows the user to change certain settings, such as the length of the timer before the alert will trigger. As well as that, I would like it to display certain graphs and perform statistical functions; eg. being able to see the vibration levels in real-time as they come in, and perhaps to record a session, and then analyse the recorded data afterwards.

Although the system would be useful for anyone who regularly uses running water, it is primarily aimed at those who are more prone to forgetfulness. This would include families with young children, those with dyslexia, and the elderly, specifically those with dementia.
